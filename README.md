# What is MultimerMapper?
It is a computational tool for the integration, analysis and visualization of AlphaFold interaction landscapes. It is presented as an innovative tool designed to help researchers understand and visualize large protein complexes easily using protein structure prediction.

The manuscript of the methodology is being written and the software is still under active development... So, keep an eye on it ;)

Here's how it works:
 - **Start with protein sequences**: Input a list of protein sequences you want to study. Typically, they will come from an interactomic experiment.
 - **Generate predictions**: MultimerMapper guides you to create the most informative set of protein structure predictions using AF2-multimer (AF3 soon!).
 - **Analyze interactions**: The tool examines how proteins interact in different combinations (2-mers, 3-mers, etc.) and compares these interactions.
 - **Classify interactions**: MultimerMapper categorizes protein-protein interactions as: *static* (always present), *dynamic positive* (only activated in certain modeling contexts), *dynamic negative* (inhibited in different modeling context).
 - **Visualize results**: The tool creates 2D and 3D visualizations to help you answer:
    - How proteins assemble into larger complexes?
    - Which interactions are stable or changing?
    - What are the potential stoichiometry of the complexes?
 - **Iterate and refine**: MultimerMapper suggests new combinations to predict, helping you explore the "interaction landscape" until you have a complete picture.
 - **Gain insights**: Use the visualizations and analyses to infer the most likely structures and dynamics of your protein complexes.
By combining predictions and smart analysis, MultimerMapper helps bridge the gap between individual protein structures and complex molecular assemblies, offering new perspectives on how proteins work together in cells.

# How does it works?
The software can perform several tasks by analyzing AF2-multimer (AF3 comming soon) predictions ensembles of different combinations of proteins separated in two different directories:

    2-mers: contains all possible pairwise interaction predictions of the set of proteins (homo-2-mers and hetero-2-mers)
    N-mers: contains diifferent combinations (3-mers, 4-mers, etc.) interaction predictions of the set of proteins that 
    
It maps all PPIs and RRCs present in the predictions by decomposing the models into their pairwise sub-components and captures how they change depending on the modelling context (which other proteins were present in the models and in which quantity). This information is converted into PPI and RRC graph representations inside MultimerMapper that you can visually explore in interactive HTML plots. The graphs are also used to simulate thousands of times the assembly paths of the complex(es) using random walks and explore the "stoichiomeric space". Each stoichiometry is scored depending on the NÂº and classification of their contacts and interaction between proteins, keeping track of the frequency of walked paths and stoichiometries. At the end, the most frequent and best scored stichiometries will represent the most likely stoichiometry(ies) of the complex(es).

# Installation
MultimerMapper requires Anaconda/Miniconda (Miniconda installation guide: https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/miniconda-install) to create an isolated environment for the software.
To install it, clone the repo in the directory you want, cd to the repo and install the environment using conda:
```sh
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/elviorodriguez/MultimerMapper.git

# Go to repo dir
cd MultimerMapper

# Create "MultimerMapper" environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
Every time you want to use MultimerMapper, activate the environment with the following command:
```sh
# Activate MultimerMapper env to run the pipeline
conda activate MultimerMapper
```

## Add multimer_mapper alias (optional)
You can add an alias to run MultimerMapper by adding the following to your ```.bashrc``` file:
```sh
# Replace <user_name> with your user_name and <path_to_MM> with the repository path
alias multimer_mapper="python /home/<user_name>/<path_to_MM>/multimer_mapper.py"
```
Restart the shell and you will be able to call MultimerMapper using ```multimer_mapper``` as a shell command.
```
# Display multimer_mapper help message
multimer_mapper -h
```

# Verify installation
You can verify the installation as follows:

```sh
# Activate MultimerMapper env to run the pipeline
conda activate MultimerMapper

# Take a look at the usage (this must give no errors)
python multimer_mapper.py -h
```
There is a testing dataset composed of three trypanosomatid proteins (EAF6, EPL1 and PHD1) with all possible 2-mers and N-mers combinations that reached convergence. First run the pipeline only with 2-mers, and take a look at the output located at ```tests/output_2mers``` or ```tests/output_Nmers```, depending on which you run.

```sh
# Only 2-mers
python multimer_mapper.py --AF_2mers tests/EAF6_EPL1_PHD1/2-mers --out_path tests/output_2mers tests/EAF6_EPL1_PHD1/HAT1-HAT3_proteins.fasta

# Both 2-mers and N-mers
python multimer_mapper.py --AF_2mers tests/EAF6_EPL1_PHD1/2-mers --AF_Nmers tests/EAF6_EPL1_PHD1/N-mers --out_path tests/output_Nmers tests/EAF6_EPL1_PHD1/HAT1-HAT3_proteins.fasta
```

## Using manual_domains.tsv
We highly recommend to use the semi-automatic domain detection algorithm inside MultimerMapper to get the best results, as the pipeline relies on proper definition of compact domains to prerform RMSD trajectories and capture conformational changes. However, if you know the exact start and end positions of the globular domains of your proteins, you can use a ```manuals_domains.tsv``` file to define them:
```sh
# Only 2-mers
python multimer_mapper.py --AF_2mers tests/EAF6_EPL1_PHD1/2-mers --manual_domains tests/EAF6_EPL1_PHD1/manual_domains.tsv --out_path tests/output_2mers tests/EAF6_EPL1_PHD1/HAT1-HAT3_proteins.fasta 

# Both 2-mers and N-mers
python multimer_mapper.py --AF_2mers tests/EAF6_EPL1_PHD1/2-mers --AF_Nmers tests/EAF6_EPL1_PHD1/N-mers --manual_domains tests/EAF6_EPL1_PHD1/manual_domains.tsv --out_path tests/output_Nmers tests/EAF6_EPL1_PHD1/HAT1-HAT3_proteins.fasta 
```
Note that you need to define the span of both disordered loops and globular domains. Have a look at the example file to know its format.

## Visualization of Interactive 2D PPI graphs
One of the main outputs of MultimerMapper is the interactive 2D PPI graph. You can find it inside the output folder (tests/expected_output/2D_graph.html). It represents proteins as nodes and disctinct interaction modes between proteins as edges:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4629b19c-ad78-4d20-9e73-e9803650ce1a)

The color of the nodes stands for the dynamic clasification of the protein (Static, Dynamic Negative, Dynamic Positive). Edge colors represents the classification of the interactions (Static, Dynamic Negative, Dynamic Positive) and the shape of the edge represents the intensity of the classification (solid, dash, dot). In cases in which there is no N-mers or 2-mers data, edges and proteins will be colored in an orange tone.

You can display more information about the proteins in different modelling contexts by clicking above nodes. The hovertext gives you information about detected domain spans and metrics variation (RMSD against reference and mean pLDDT) depending on the modelling context.

You can display more information about the PPIs in different modelling contexts by clicking above edges. The hovertext gives you information about detected interactions metrics in 2-mers and N-mers (pTM, ipTM, pDockQ, N_models that surpassed cutoffs), which depend on the modelling context.

## Visualization of Interactive 3D RRC graphs
Two RRC graphs are generated. One uses py3Dmol as rendering software (tests/expected_output/3D_graph_py3Dmol.html) and the other uses Plotly (tests/expected_output/3D_graph_plotly.html). Both graphs shows RRCs between proteins, their classification and the surface residue centroids involved in different interactions. However, py3Dmol gives less interactivity but better depth perspective and nicer protein backbone visualizations; while Plotly is much more interactive but gives less depth awareness. Use the one you like the most.

# Exploring pLDDT clusters, RMSF and RMSD trajectories

## 
Let's look at the example pLDDT clusters of PHD1 (tests/expected_output/RMSF_and_plddt_clusters/PHD1/PHD1-pLDDT_clusters.png):

![PHD1-pLDDT_clusters](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63f7abc0-68d2-4532-b74b-9c4b89e51607)

We can see 2 clusters. The main difference between them is in the domain 6. If we open the metadata TSV file

## Visualization of RMSD trajectories
In ChimeraX, open the sample weighted RMSD trajectory located in tests/expected_output/monomer_trajectories/PHD1/PHD1_domain_6
```sh
# Re-align the models to the lowest RMSD model (it will always be #1.1)
mm #1.2-1000 to #1.1

# Apply AlphaFold pLDDT color scheme on the bfactor
color bfactor palette alphafold

# Open the slider on the model #1 series
mseries slider #1
```
You can play/stop the slider, slow/accelerate it down using the buttons on the bottom-right slider. Once you find a good pose, you can save a video with the red record button:
